            <dd> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured, systematic methodology that development teams use to design, build, test, deploy, and maintain high-quality, cost-effective software within a set timeframe.<br>
                The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through detailed forward planning and ensure the final software meets or exceeds all customer and stakeholder requirements. </dd>
            <ul><h2> The Key Phases of the SDLC : </h2>
             
                <ol><b>1 Planning and Requirement Analysis:</ol></b>
                <dd>This initial phase involves gathering detailed requirements from all stakeholders 
                (customers, sales, domain experts, etc.),defining the project scope, <br>and conducting feasibility studies  (economic, technical, legal). 
                The output is typically a detailed Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.</dd>
                <ol><b> 2 Design (Architecture): </b></ol>
                <dd>  Software architects and engineers use the SRS to plan the overall system architecture and design the software's components, interfaces, and databases.<br>
                     This phase results in a Design Document Specification (DDS) or Software Design Document (SDD), which serves as a blueprint for development. </dd>
                <ol><b> 3 Implementation (Coding): </b></ol>
                <dd>   The actual writing of the software code takes place here, based on the design specifications.<br>
                     Developers use appropriate programming languages and tools, following organizational coding guidelines. </dd>
                <ol><b> 4 Testing:  </b></ol>
                <dd> The developed software is rigorously tested by a Quality Assurance (QA) team to identify defects, bugs, and other issues.<br>
                     This includes various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, to ensure the product meets the original requirements.  </dd>
                <ol><b> 5 Deployment: </b></ol>
                <dd> Once the software has been fully tested and approved, it is released into the production environment where end-users can access it. 
                    <br>This may occur in stages, such as a limited beta release before general availability.  </dd>
                <ol><b> 6 Maintenance: </b></ol>
                <dd> The final stage involves ongoing support, monitoring system performance, fixing new bugs, resolving customer issues, and implementing software updates or enhancements as needed.  </dd>
