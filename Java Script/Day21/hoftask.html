                Task 1: Double the Numbers
            Objective: Double each number in an array.
            use the map method to create a new array where each number is doubled.
            
            Task 2: Using map
            Objective: Create a new array with each element squared.
             use the map method to create a new array 
             where each element is the square of the original element.
            
            Task 3: Using filter
            Objective: Filter out even numbers.
            Instructions: Given an array of numbers, use the filter method 
            to create a new array that contains only the odd numbers.
            
            Task 4: Filter Long Words
            Objective: Filter out words longer than 5 characters.
            Instructions: Given an array of words, use the filter method

            Task 5: Sum of Numbers
            Objective: Calculate the sum of all numbers in an array using reduce method.
            Instructions: Given an array of numbers, 
            use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all the numbers.
            
            Task 6: Calculate Average
            Objective: Calculate the average of an array of numbers.
            Instructions: Given an array of numbers, 
            use the reduce method to calculate the average.
            
            Task 7: Filter Adults
            Objective: Filter out people who are under 18.
            Instructions: Given an array of objects representing people, use the filter method to create a new array that contains only people who are 18 or older.
            const people = [
              { name: "John", age: 17 },
              { name: "Jane", age: 22 },
              { name: "Jim", age: 15 },
              { name: "Jack", age: 19 }
